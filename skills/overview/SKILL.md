description: Package overview for @mongez/react-localization — what it exports, how it relates to @mongez/localization, and when to use each of its two exports.
when_to_use: User imports from @mongez/react-localization for the first time, user asks what the package does or what it exports, user is deciding whether to use jsxConverter globally or transX per call site, user needs install or import instructions.

# Overview

`@mongez/react-localization` is the React-side bridge for `@mongez/localization`. It does **one thing**: replace `:placeholder` (or `{{placeholder}}`) tokens in a translation with React children, so you can drop `<strong>`, `<a href>`, or any element straight into a translated sentence.

The package is small on purpose. Two exports:

- `jsxConverter` — the placeholder-to-React converter. Plug into `setLocalizationConfigurations({ converter: jsxConverter })`.
- `transX` — a `trans` variant pre-bound to `jsxConverter`. Use per call when you don't want to flip the global converter.

## Install

```sh
yarn add @mongez/react-localization
# peer: @mongez/localization, react >= 18
```

## Import pattern

```ts
import { jsxConverter, transX } from "@mongez/react-localization";
```

Everything else — `extend`, `trans`, `setCurrentLocaleCode`, `groupedTranslations`, `transObject`, `localizationEvents`, count rules — comes from `@mongez/localization`.

## The two paths

### Path A: wire `jsxConverter` globally

```ts
import { setLocalizationConfigurations } from "@mongez/localization";
import { jsxConverter } from "@mongez/react-localization";

setLocalizationConfigurations({
  defaultLocaleCode: "en",
  fallback: "en",
  converter: jsxConverter,
});
```

Now every `trans(...)` understands JSX placeholders. The return type widens to `string | React.ReactNode[]` (the converter returns an array when at least one placeholder is found).

### Path B: keep the default converter, use `transX` per call

```ts
import { trans, plainTrans } from "@mongez/localization";
import { transX } from "@mongez/react-localization";

trans("greeting");                              // → "Hello" (string)
trans("greeting", { name: "Alice" });           // → "Hello Alice" (string)
transX("greeting", { name: <em>Alice</em> });   // → React fragment array
```

This path keeps `trans` strongly typed as `string` for the 99% of call sites that don't need JSX.

## What this package is NOT

- **Not a hooks library.** No `useLocale`, no `useTranslate`, no `<Translate>`. `transX` is a plain function call.
- **Not a subscription layer.** `setCurrentLocaleCode("ar")` does NOT re-render components that already rendered. Drive the re-render from a parent (state, atom, event).
- **Not a registry.** Translations live in `@mongez/localization`'s module-level state. Call `extend("en", {...})` from the core package.

## Scope boundaries

| Concern | Lives where |
|---|---|
| Translation registry, locale switching, count rules | `@mongez/localization` |
| JSX placeholder support | `@mongez/react-localization` (this package) |
| State management / locale-driven re-renders | `@mongez/react-atom` or your own state library |
| Event bus | `@mongez/events` |

## React version

React 18+ for the peer dep. Only `React.Fragment` is used internally; the floor is set by the rest of the `@mongez/*` family.
